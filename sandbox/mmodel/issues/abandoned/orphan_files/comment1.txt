"""
TO BE CORRECTED:
- eats cyrulic in NAMES

LIMITATIONS (by design):
- annual only
- byRow only 
- no var descriptions in file (pivot column needed) - NAMES
- decimal precisions in output xls file not corrected (can be 0 and 2)
- one model sheet per file
- one occurrence of variable in reulting sheet (variable appearing only once)
- decorations of dt_before_equations are hard-coded
- no formatting in Excel file

SCENARIOS

     if no user specification - write all controls in orginal order,
                              - followed by data without controls in orginal order
                              - year depth as in historic data

FLOW
# - write to xls
# - one input xls file
# - larger xls file (flatten folder)
# - experiment with actual data - full cycle (flatten folder)
# - (source + markup) vs flattened db vs db dump
